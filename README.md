### About Me
I am a driven and articulate engineer interested in product analytics. With a strong medical device mechanical design and manufacturing background, I aim to apply these skills to derive insights from big data. During my undergraduate studies, I specialized in research in orthopedic biomechanics and ergonomic association between surgeon characteristics and laparoscopic device strain. Upon completing my bachelorâ€™s degree, I became interested in entrepreneurship and product development. In 2021, I represented North Carolina State University as spokesperson, which led to her senior design team winning first place in the Atlantic Coast Conference InVenture Prize Competition. My passion for research and growing interest in surgical robotics led to her acquiring a masterâ€™s degree with a thesis topic of developing a novel electromechanical robotic power transmission for advanced colonoscopy procedures in 2023. In my product analytics current role, I utilize mechanical design, programming, and data analytics skills.
